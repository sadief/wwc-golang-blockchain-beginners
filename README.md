# Golang and Blockchain for Beginners

Here you will find the exercises to follow along with the workshop `Golang and Blockchain for Beginners` at Women Who Code CONNECT NYC on December 5th. This workshop will hopefully be accessible to those brand new to Golang and will provide an opportunity to get a feel for the language by creating a small centralized Blockchain.
